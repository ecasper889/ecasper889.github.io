			<h2> There are some sports that I like to watch, and some sports that I prefer to play. </h2>
			<dt> Volleyball </dt>
				<dd> I have played volleyball since 5th grade. First, I started to play volleyball at my middle school. Then, I started to play indoor club volleyball. Eventually, I began playing 2v2 beach volleyball. I played competitively all thoroughout high school. In college, I play intramural volleyball with friends. I like to watch Wisconsin's volleyball team and the USA volleyball team. <br> Here is a link to the Badger volleyball schedule: <a href="https://uwbadgers.com/sports/womens-volleyball/schedule/2025" target="_blank">Wisconsin Volleyball Scedule</a> </dd>
